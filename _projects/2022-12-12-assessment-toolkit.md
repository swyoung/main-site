### Project Description
The Values-Sensitive Library Assessment Toolkit serves to model a value system for library assessment practice, with the goal of helping practitioners identify and apply the values that are important for their assessment practice. The toolkit takes the form of a card deck, presenting 10 values along with 3 activities for working with the values.

### Collaborators
This toolkit is derived from extensive survey-based and interview-based research involving members of the library assessment community. I wish to thank those practitioners for sharing their time and energy with me.The toolkit also builds on prior prototypes that I’ve co-developed with other collaborators listed in the projects below.

### Timeline
2019–2022

### Resources
For more on the process that went into the research and design of the toolkit, view the [presentation at the 2022 Library Assessment Conference](/assets/pdf/ethical_assessment_toolkit_lac_2022_slides.pdf).
